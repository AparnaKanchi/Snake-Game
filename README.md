# Snake Game

Snake game is designed in such a way that when the game starts, the snake has the body length of three and moves in the right direction. 
The player must direct the snake towards the food particle and if the snake engulfs the particle, it's length increases and food particle appears again in a random location.
The game terminates when the snake either touches it's body or the wall. Then the score board is displayed.
